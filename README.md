This layout leverages:

- combos to keep user on the default layer as much as possible, including some symbols such as ()"'{}[].
- osl access through combos to reduce layer switching for single characters and functions
- macros to launch apps and perform things that don't seem to map well to simple apps and media keycodes
- bilateral combinations for tap mod keys to reduce roll activation on the same half
- Modified HRMs to put shift on thumb keys and others primarily in index finger columns
